<h1>Redlining<h1/> 
    <h2>What is redlining</h2>

    <p>In the United States, redlining is an illegal act where people residing in a certain part of a city or town are deemed unworthy of receiving a loan from the bank. This act of redlining is usually due to the race or religion of people living in that particular area. Redlining was put to a stop in 1968 with the fair housing act, though redlining does still happen to minority groups such as black and Latino communities. Compared to white communities, minority communities are at a major disadvantage because of redlining. </p>

    <h2>How redlining affects communities </h2>

    <p> Redlining communities can affect them by access to health care, poorer education, which also impacts job opportunities.</p>
  
  <h2> Access to healthcare</h2>  
  
  <p>Redlining affects the access to health care for some people, they don't get to have the same privileges as wealthy individuals. Without health care people may not have the ability to work as some illnesses make it impossible to do certain jobs. </p>
  
   <h2>Jobs</h2>  
  
  <p>After falling ill for a certain amount of time the bills and other things that have to be paid are going to accumulate and there are going to be debts .</p>
  
  <h2>Loans</h2>  
  
  <p> They might ask for loans to the bank and that's the next point. If someone who is suffering of financial problems might ask for a loan and one problem might be that they are not going to be granted a loan because they have no money to pay back after being given the loan or a second problem is that the bank, because the person is poor or not from a good neighborhood they will not grant them the loan and the person is gonna go to poverty for maybe the rest of their life unless they get better. Eventhough finding a job might be hard.</p>
  
   <h2>homes/community</h2>  
  
  <p>If someone wants to buy a house but does not have the funds, not enough money, or simply comes from a community that does not have a good reputation, the bank will want to give them the house. Because home appraisals look at past property value trends in neighborhoods, they reinforce the discrimination redlining codified by keeping real estate prices lower in historically Black neighborhoods. That, in turn, makes lenders assume they're taking on more risk when they extend financing in those areas.</p>
